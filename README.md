## 1. What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?
I began my college career as an accounting major. I took a programming class, COSC 175, and I saw the possibilities of programming. I could
create something that was my own and like no other. This possibility drew me to the major, and I took this class because web development is
a great interest to me. 
## 2. What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?
My ideal progression is to eventually create something that is my own whether it is an app, website, or software. I want what I create to 
be able to benefit lives in a positive way
## 3. What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?
I have experience with java,c++, html, css, scala, and a little python. I learned web development languages on my own, but am still an
amateur. I have created my own unpublished websites, but still have alot to learn.
